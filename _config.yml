  The Idle Institute (est. 2017) is a storytelling lab:
  a collective of writers, filmmakers, sound-artists and engineers founded by
  Sonia Bernac and Eliot Allison. Combining theories of the public sphere with
  quantum physics, they investigate the potentialities of the story – seen as
  virtual matter and a precise political tool. This emerges from the
  presumption of an unstable narrative field, in which they examine unexpected
  couplings and clashes between narrative particles. The Idle Institute’s
  projects build from narrative experiments: poetic traps in urban space,
  phone pranks, impersonation games and sci-fi installations. Currently
  developing a theory of the narratology of the public sphere, their
  research explores narrative entanglement, machine(s) of writing and
  technologies of storytelling. They cheat occasionally, but only when it
  makes a good story...
