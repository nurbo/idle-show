- Inferring presence during a conversation of which you know you *should* be a part;
- Deciding not to speak because of your accent (instead feigning eloquence through silence);
- Making sure your face isnâ€™t misread as disagreeing;
- Voicing adversarial viewpoints towards: racism, sexism, classism, etc. without getting into an argument;
- Pretending to understand things when someone tells a long anecdote in which you just cannot pay any more attention.
